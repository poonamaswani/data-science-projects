# data-science-projects
A collection of real-world data science and machine learning projects demonstrating end-to-end workflows — from EDA to model evaluation.

# 📊 Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science project repository.  
This repository contains a collection of **end-to-end data science projects**, including project reports and Jupyter notebooks, showcasing my approach to problem-solving, data analysis, and predictive modelling.

Each project demonstrates how data can be transformed into actionable insights through structured analysis, modelling, and clear communication.

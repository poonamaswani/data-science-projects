# 📊 Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science project repository.  
This repository contains a collection of **end-to-end data science projects**, including project reports and Jupyter notebooks, showcasing my approach to problem-solving, data analysis, and predictive modelling.

Each project demonstrates how data can be transformed into actionable insights through structured analysis, modelling, and clear communication.

## 🚀 What This Repository Showcases

- End-to-end data science workflows
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modelling & machine learning
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Handling real-world data challenges (missing data, class imbalance)
- Model interpretability & explainability
- Business-focused storytelling and insights

The projects aim to balance technical depth with clear business communication, demonstrating how analytical outputs translate into real-world decisions.

## 📌 Project Highlights

### 🔍 Anamoly Detection
  Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns or observations in data that deviate significantly from normal behaviour and may indicate errors, risks, or emerging issues.
  
### 👥 Customer Segmentation with Clustering
  Customer segmentation using clustering groups customers with similar behaviours or characteristics to enable targeted marketing, personalised experiences, and better business decisions.
  
### 🎓 Student Dropout Prediction

Predicts student dropout risk across multiple lifecycle stages
Compares machine learning approaches
Focuses on interpretability and early intervention
Includes a business-focused report for non-technical stakeholders

### 🧾 NLP Topic Modeling

Analyses customer reviews from multiple platforms to uncover recurring themes and pain points
Applies BERTopic for contextual topic discovery and compares outcomes across data slices
Uses emotion analysis to validate sentiment patterns linked to key topics
Extends topic interpretation with an LLM-based workflow and benchmarks results with Gensim LDA
Produces actionable recommendations that translate text insights into business improvements


### 🏦 Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detects fraudulent card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset
Compares supervised and anomaly-detection approaches
Optimises decision thresholds using business cost trade-offs
Uses SHAP to explain high-risk predictions for investigator teams

(Additional projects will be added over time.)

## 📄 Project Reports

Each project includes:

- A technical Jupyter notebook documenting the analysis and modelling process
- A business-friendly report summarising insights, methodology, and recommendations

This structure reflects how data science work is typically delivered in professional environments.

### 🔍 How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to a project folder
2. Review the Jupyter notebook for technical implementation
3. Read the project report for high-level insights and conclusions
